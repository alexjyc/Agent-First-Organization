A default of 5 is a good starting point, but if you're looking for more robust testing, you might want to increase this number to capture a wider range of interactions.\n\n2. **Number of Goals (`--num_goals`)**: Similar to conversations, this parameter defines how many distinct goals or tasks you want to simulate. The default is also 5, but depending on the complexity of your chatbot and the variety of tasks it handles, you may want to adjust this to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n\n3. **Maximum Turns (`--max_turns`)**: This sets the upper limit on the number of exchanges in each conversation. The default is 5, which is typically sufficient for most interactions. However, if your conversations tend to be longer or more complex, consider increasing this limit.\n\n4. **Model (`--model`)**: This specifies the OpenAI model used to generate user utterances. The default is `gpt-4o`, but you can experiment with other models like `gpt-4o-mini` to see if they yield better results for your specific use case.\n\nBy adjusting these parameters, you can tailor the user simulator to better evaluate your chatbot's performance under various scenarios.

The key parameters you can adjust include:\n   - `--num_convos`: Set this to the number of synthetic conversations you want to simulate (e.g., 100 to 500).\n   - `--num_goals`: Define how many goals/tasks you want to simulate (e.g., 2-3 primary goals).\n   - `--max_turns`: Specify the maximum number of turns per conversation (default is 5, but you can adjust this based on your needs).\n   - `--model`: Choose the OpenAI model type for synthesizing user utterances (e.g., `gpt-4o` or `gpt-4o-mini`).\n\n2. **Running the Simulator**: Once your configuration file is set up, you can run the user simulator. This will simulate user interactions based on the parameters you've defined. The simulator will generate a large number of user inputs to evaluate your chatbot's performance under different scenarios.\n\n3. **Evaluation Metrics**: After running the simulations, you can analyze the performance using the metrics provided by the framework:\n   - User's goal completion rate\n   - User's goal completion efficiency\n   - Bot's goal completion rate\n\n4. **Iterate and Adjust**: Based on the results from the simulations, you may want to iterate on your parameters and refine your chatbot's design to improve performance.\n\nFor detailed instructions and examples, you can refer to the [User Simulator documentation](https://arklexai.github.io/Agent-First-Organization/docs/Evaluation/UserSimulator) in the Arklex framework.
